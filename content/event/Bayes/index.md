summary: Grand rounds presentation for the McGill Department of Medicine.
abstract: "The three objectives of this talk were to \n
1) appreciate the limitations of standard statistical inference \n
2) understand the general philosophy and basic mechanism of Bayesian inference \n
3) appreciate the practical advantages of Bayesian inference in analyzing contemporary CV randomized clinical trials   \n

My take home messages from this presentation were;     \n   
1) poor statistical analyses, whether frequentist or Bayesian, are harmful to science   \n 
2) many times frequentist and Bayesain inferences are concordant \n
3) sometimes they are not and the Bayesian approach provides additional insights \n
4) these insights will remain hidden unless the Bayesian approach is employed"
