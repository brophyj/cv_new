summary: Grand rounds presentation for St. Mary's Hospital Department of Medicine.
abstract: "The three objectives of this talk were to \n
1) Develop critical appraisal skills for the DAPT evidence base \n
2) Review and understand techniques for evidence synthesis of this evidence base \n
3) Appreciate the role and limitations of professional society guideline processes   \n

My take home messages from this presentation were;     \n   
1) For acute coronary synromes, inconclusive evidence for any net clinical superiority between different DAPT regimes, but big cost difference exist  \n 
2) For stable CAD, no evidence for net clinical benefit with DAPT over ASA alone\n
3) DAPT duration, awaiting more evidence that shorter duration provides equivalent benefit, but may be considered for those at very high bleeding risk \n
4) Current CCS guideline recommendations needs revisiting"
