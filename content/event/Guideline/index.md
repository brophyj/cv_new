summary: Presentation for the McGill Department of Medicine course entitlted "The ‘Crisis’ in Health Research, and its Implications for Research, Health Policy, and Clinical Practice""
abstract: "The three objectives of this talk were to \n
1) appreciate the mechanisms (chance, onfounding, and bias) whereby guidelines may inadequately interpret & synthesize the evidence \n
2) appreciate the adverse health consequences of guidelines \n
3) appreciate how the quality of the guideline process may be improved   \n

My take home messages from this presentation were;     \n   
1) guidelines often involve uncritical evaluations of the literature which can provides a veneer of study integrity, objectivity, scientific validity and independence to sometimes questionable evidence  \n 
2) guideliens can also be subject to subjectivity, cognitive biases, and conflicts of interest \n
3) poor guidelines can lead to i) acceptance of marginal or ineffective therapies as “standard of care” ii) overtreatment iii) diversion of funds from other worthwhile priorities iv) inhibition local critical evidence assessment, clinical judgement and patient preferences in routine decision making v) provide false certainty removing the impetus for replication studies to resolve residual uncertaintyies\n
4) guideline process could be improved by enhancing i) multidisciplinary committee composition (methodologists, economists, multi-stakeholder) ii) enhance transparency iii) improve critical appraisal process iv) improved managment of conflicts of interest"
