summary: Meta-analysis - Online lecture (April 2020)
abstract: "This is one of the  lectures (April 2020) given for the Intermediate Epidemiology course.     


My take home messages from this lecture were;     \n   
1) Always appropriate to perform a systematic review but a meta-analysis may not always be appropriate  \n 
2) Random effects model is always to be preferred (will reduce to fixed effect if no between study variation) \n 
3) Biases may also exist in MA and so critical analytical and reading skills remain essential"
