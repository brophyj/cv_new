summary: Presentation for the annual scientific meeting of the Quebec Association of Vascular Sciences
abstract: "The three objectives of this talk were to \n
1) Examine the role of inflammation in coronary artery disease \n 
2) Critically examine recent studies of colchicine \n
3) Synthesize the results and put them into clinical context \n

My take home messages from this presentation were;     \n   
1) There is histological evidence about the role of inflammation in CAD \n  
2) The use of colchicine for secondary prevention of CAD is worthy of consideration \n 
3) But given the residual uncertainties, routine use of colchicine for CAD premature"
