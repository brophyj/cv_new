The majority of Covid-19 cases in Quebec are on the island of Montreal. Using daily reports from [Quebec Public Health](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/situation-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-in-montreal/), I have made a few graphs that explore the rate of infections for the different Montreal neighborhoods.     

Data visualizations help to appreciate the time and geographic variations of Covid-19 infections.     

The left panel shows the large variations in the severity in the number of cases across different regions of Montreal. The right panel shows the 5 day moving averages of new cases which are decreased in all areas & provides some support for the progressive re-opening that is happening.    

Continued public health measures, testing and monitoring are obviously essential.
