<p>While there is no doubt regarding the physical, mental, and economic carnage due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is considerable debate regarding the evidence of masks to reduce its spread. At times, the debate seems governed more by partisan political views than by scientific evidence. I have commented on this issue of masks in an earlier <a href="https://www.brophyj.com/post/covid-masks-and-poor-science/">post</a>.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the publication Nov 18 2020 of the first randomized trial evaluating masks, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">DANMASK-19</a>, during the current covid-19 pandemic and a meta- analysis of older trials seems to have heightened rather than reduced the uncertainty regarding their effectiveness.</p>
<p>I explored this paradox in a <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/24/covid-19-controversial-trial-may-actually-show-that-masks-protect-the-wearer/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork">BMJ opinion article</a> which I briefly summarize in this post.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Null hypothesis significance testing can create as many <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913">problems</a> as it hopes to avoid. Main issues in poor interpretations of “negative” studies due to nullism and dichotomania.</p></li>
<li><p>DANMASK study deemed “<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/do-masks-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19-">negative</a>” but actually provides as much evidence for 33% reduction in infections as for no effect</p></li>
<li><p>Bayesian paradigm can help. Figure shows the probability of masks preventing infections (with a non-informative prior) in the wearer is 81%, quite a different interpretation than simply a “negative” study <img src="fig.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Bayesian approach also allows interpreting DANMASK in the context of prior knowledge about masks in non-Covid settings as presented in Cochrane review. The data is consistent and robust (84% probability of benefit) <img src="info_post.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Epi 101 - Don’t confuse rates with overall risk. DANMASK and previous pre-Covid mask studies reported infections avoided over 4 weeks. Not the same as risk prevented over the duration of a long (&gt;9 mo) pandemic -&gt; 36 (95%CI 12 -57) fewer infections per 1000 mask wearers</p></li>
<li><p>Benefits could be greater in higher incidence setting, with better mask compliance, and if protection to others is considered</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence is definitely not perfect but likely “good enough” given low cost and few side effects.</p></li>
