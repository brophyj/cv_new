A previous post referred to the difficulty some researchers / reviewers have in distinguishing between **absence of evidence and evidence of absence**, even though this issue has been well discussed for almost 30 years (see [here](https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485) and [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/signif4.pdf)). Despite the fact that these publications have several thousand citations, this remains an important problem, even in high quality medical journals.     

For example, I recently read a [NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2204511) randomized clinical trial (RCT) investigating whether the addition of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) to standard CPR (cCPR) can improve survival and diminish anoxic brain injury. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a frequent event and its devastating
consequences are only partially mitigated by rapid commencement of basic life
support with high-quality cCPR. There
remains a substantial subset of individuals who do not respond rapidly
to these measures and whether eCPR
can improve outcomes is an important clinical question.
In this trial, the primary outcome, 30 day survival without significant neurological
deficit, was an odds ratio of 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 3.5; P =
0.52) in favor eCPR. This lead to the
conclusion "In patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
extracorporeal CPR and conventional CPR had similar effects on survival
with a favorable neurological outcome".    

This trial  addressed an important
clinical question in the most challenging of research environments and the authors 
are to be congratulated on their trial design, its execution, and a
nuanced discussion. However the constraints of standard statistical
analyses limits the quantitative appreciation of their data, and
prevents a full and comprehensive exploitation and updating of past
knowledge. Trials that fail to meet
statistical significance and are often incorrectly thought of as
"negative" trials, and null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) favors this confusion
between "*absence of evidence and evidence of absence*".     

The goal of this communication is to demonstrate that a Bayesian
perspective permits additional insights into the specific clinical
question regarding the added value of eCPR following an out-of-hospital
arrest in patients refractory to cCPR and by concentrating on posterior probabilities intrinsically avoids these misinterpretations.    

This post does not reiterate the many reasons to be wary of
null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), p values and confidence
intervals[see here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913). Rather it assumes the reader has perhaps heard that
Bayesian methods mirror our intuitive learning and diagnostic processes
and is curious about its potential application to RCT analyses and
interpretations. Bayesian approaches provide benefits over standard
statistical analyses by avoiding dichotomizing results into statistical significance or not, with an
obligatory loss of information and understanding. In addition, Bayesian analyses concentrate on direct estimation of the parameters of interest accompanied by direct probability statements regarding their uncertainty(herein the
risk of survival with intact neurological status), as well as permitting the
incorporation prior knowledge.    

These probability statements arise from the posterior distribution
according to the Bayes Thereom, expressed as follows:
$$ \text{Posterior}  = \frac{\text{Probability of the data} * \text{Prior}}{\text{Normalizing Constant}} $$

Therefore, in addition to the current data summarized by the probability
of the data (likelihood function), prior probability distributions are
required. Because our main focus is the analysis and interpretation of
the current RCT alone, an initial analysis may use a
default vague parameter prior ($log(\theta) \sim Normal [0, 2.50]$,
thereby assuring that the posterior distribution is dominated by the
observed data.     

Posterior distributions are summarized with medians and 95%
highest-density intervals (credible intervals (CrI)), defined as the
narrowest interval containing 95% of the probability density function. Bayesian analyses permit not only calculations of the
posterior probability of any additional survival with eCPR (OR \>1.00),
but also of clinically meaningful benefits. While there is no universal
definition for a clinically meaningful benefit, a survival OR \>1.10 may
be an acceptable threshold for many. Bayesian analyses also allows
calculation of the probability between any two points. For example,
rather than simply comparing if the survival of one treatment is better
than another, one can calculate a range of practical equivalence (ROPE)
between treatments. While different ranges may be proposed, +/- 10%
seems a reasonable small difference that many would consider as
equivalent.       

The graphical presentation of these results is shown below

This Bayesian analysis, using a default
vague prior, produces an odds ratio (OR) 1.32 with 95% CrI 0.54 - 3.22) which aligns with the original analysis (OR, 1.4; 95% CI
0.5 - 3.5) confirms the minimal impact of the default vague prior and
reveals a Bayesian analysis completely dominated by the observed data. The eCPR probability density function for improved survival with eCPR
is 73% with a 66% probability that this exceeds the clinically defined meaningful cutpoint of at least a 10% survival benefit. The probability of equivalence between the two techniques is 13%.    

The “take home” message from this Bayesian reanalysis is that standard statistical analyses resulting in a conclusion
of “similar survival effects of eCPR to cCPR” may be overly simplified and potentially inaccurate. This
Bayesian analysis demonstrates that at present definitive conclusions regarding the superiority, inferiority,
or equivalence of either approach are impossible. Rather the possibility of a clinically meaningful benefit,
or less likely the possibility of clinically meaningful harm, has not been reasonably excluded and continued
research is necessary to clarify the residual uncertainties. The final dilemma confronting clinicians is that
even Bayesian analyses of randomized trials provide only probability estimates for average treatment effects
and not for the more elusive individual treatment effect.

Of course, an added benefit of the Bayesian analysis is its ability to incorporate previous knowledge.
