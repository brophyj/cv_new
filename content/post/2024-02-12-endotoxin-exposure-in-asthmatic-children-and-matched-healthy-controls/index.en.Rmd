### Background
Here is a critical appraisal of this week's article. Recall that the goal is to not only improve critical appraisal skills but also to think about research questions, designs, and the necessary compromises that are often required in research. Hopefully this adds another dimension to typical journal clubs where either an article in uncritically endorsed enthusiastically or trashed unmercifully, although this is sometimes quite merited    
<br>
For reasons I am most unclear about, this week's selected article was the 2005 publication [Endotoxin exposure in asthmatic children and matched healthy controls: results of IPEADAM study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15926941/), Although not described as such, this was apparently a nested case-control study from a 1999 crosssectional study by the same [authors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1313925/), of over 1500 completed questionnaires. Cases were children between the ages of 4 and 17 who had a study diagnosis of probable asthma. These <span style="color: red;">*asthmatic*</span> children were matched for sex, age and sib-ship size with children living in
asthma free households and the following main conclusions reported.

A critical analysis should consider bias and statistical issues

### Biases

It is helpful to consider biases in observational studies according to the following grouping     
- selection       
- misinformation           
- confounding      

#### Selection bias

[Selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) is a distortion in the measure of association due to a sample selection such the measured association is not representative of what exists in the target population.

After identification of the research question, the next step is to consider which population is to be studied and in this study one can distinguish between several      
- target population (all children in the UK)     
- study population (all those with a chance of being in the study, ie the 1500 children who completed the original questionnaire)     
- sample population (the 200 children in Figure 1)     
- analyzed sample population (the 90 matched pairs of children)      

In their previous [work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1313925/), the authors report an asthma prevalence of approximately 20%, or about 300 children.    
- Does the study population reflect the target population?    
- Do the 200 sample children reflect the total study population?    
- Do the 90 matched pairs, the analytical sample population reflect the overall sample population? What about the missing cases?      
<br>
<span style="color: red;">Many reasons to be concerned about possible selection bias in this study.  </span>            
Let's begin by examining their Figure 1 which is reproduced below.
