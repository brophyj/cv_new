	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) is used to diagnosis acute myocardial infarction, often based on values exceeding the 99th percentile threshold (14 ng/L) of normal populations. The short- and long-term variability of hs-cTnT in stable patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 75 stable patients with CAD and 3 differing clinical profiles (stable angina [SA]; remote myocardial infarction [MI]; repetitive acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) and 25 controls without angiographic CAD, each with 15 hs-cTnT measurements over 1 year.
RESULTS: Individual results (1491 measurements) did not vary over within-day, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, or yearly time windows. The overall median was 2.8 ng/L (interquartile range [IQR] 5.2 ng/L) with the highest median (6.3 ng/L) and variability (IQR 6. 9 ng/L) in the repetitive ACS group. Diabetes, impaired renal function, and raised C-reactive protein were independent predictors of higher hs-cTnT values (average increase by 8.5 ng/L [95\% CI, 5.0-11.9], 5.0 ng/L [95\% CI, 2.0-8.1] and 4.0 ng/L (95\% CI, 1.0-7.0), respectively). The 99th percentile value of all hs-cTnT measurements in the combined stable patients with CAD was 39 ng/L compared with 14 ng/L in the non-CAD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual hs-cTnT readings in both patients with and without CAD were stable over hours, days, weeks, and months. Diabetes, poor renal function, and elevated C-reactive protein were independent predictors of higher median and IQR hs-cTnT values, often exceeding conventional thresholds. These findings highlight the need for caution and clinical contextualization in the interpretation of hs-cTnT results.},

	abstract = {Background The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Alirocumab and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial demonstrated that alirocumab reduced major cardiovascular events. However, because of the hierarchical testing strategy used for the multiple outcomes examined, the observed reduction in all-cause mortality was labeled "nominally significant" which has clouded its interpretation. Methods and Results We re-analyzed data from ODYSSEY OUTCOMES using Bayesian methods and generated various prior probabilities by incorporating mortality data from previous similar PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9) inhibitor trials. We first used data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial with a non-informative prior, then sequentially added data from ODYSSEY LONG TERM and the FOURIER trial, giving FOURIER full weight, 50\% weight and 10\%. The posterior probability of a mortality reduction using only the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data was hazard ratio 0.85 (95\% CI 0.74-0.99) which corresponded to a 98.4\% probability of a mortality benefit. When the ODYSSEY LONG TERM data were added to the analysis, the posterior probability was hazard ratio 0.84 (95\% CI 0.72-0.97) with a 99.9\% probability of mortality reduction, and when the FOURIER data were added to the analysis the posterior probability was hazard ratio 0.94 (95\% CI 0.85-1.04) with an 89.1\% probability of a mortality reduction. When the FOURIER trial was given only 50\% or 10\% weight, the probability of a mortality reduction rose 95.4\% and 98.7\%, respectively. We estimate that the probability of {\textgreater}1\% absolute risk reduction ranges from 8\% to 24\%, while the probability of {\textgreater}0.5\% absolute risk reduction ranges from 66\% to 89\%. Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates a high likelihood that alirocumab confers a reduction in all-cause mortality, despite the equivocal interpretation of the data in the original ODYSSEY OUTCOMES publication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have linked fluoroquinolones (FQs) to cardiac adverse events, including aortic dissection and aneurysm. To date, whether FQs can increase the risk of aortic or mitral regurgitation has not been studied.
OBJECTIVES: This disproportionality analysis and case-control study examined whether FQs increase the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation.
METHODS: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's adverse reporting system database was used to undertake a disproportionality analysis, and a random sample of 9,053,240 patients from the U.S. PharMetrics Plus database (IQVIA) was used for the matched nested case-control study. Current FQ exposure implied an active prescription at the index date or 30 days prior to the event date. Recent FQ exposure was defined as FQ use within days 31 to 60 and past within days 61 to 365 prior to the event date. Rate ratios (RRs) were compared to users of amoxicillin and azithromycin. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute RRs adjusting for confounders.
RESULTS: The reported odds ratio for the disproportionality analysis was 1.45 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 to 1.77). A total of 12,505 cases and 125,020 control subjects were identified in the case-control study. The adjusted RRs for current users of FQ compared with amoxicillin and azithromycin users were 2.40 (95\% CI: 1.82 to 3.16) and 1.75 (95\% CI: 1.34 to 2.29), respectively. The adjusted RRs for recent and past FQ users when compared with amoxicillin were 1.47 (95\% CI: 1.03 to 2.09) and 1.06 (95\% CI: 0.91 to 1.21), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation is highest with current use followed by recent use. No risk was observed with past use of FQs. Future studies are necessary to confirm or refute these associations.},

	abstract = {To summarise existing heart failure (HF) risk prediction models and describe the risk factors for HF-related adverse outcomes in adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from January 1996 to December 2018. Studies were eligible if they developed multivariable models for risk prediction of decompensated HF in adult patients with CHD (ACHD), death in patients with ACHD-HF or both, or if they reported corresponding predictors. A standardised form was used to extract information from selected studies. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and all studies were at moderate to high risk of bias. One study derived a model to predict the risk of a composite outcome (HF, death or arrhythmia) with a c-statistic of 0.85. Two studies applied an existing general HF model to patients with ACHD but did not report model performance. Twenty studies presented predictors of decompensated HF, and four examined patient characteristics associated with mortality (two reported predictors of both). A wide variation in population characteristics, outcome of interest and candidate risk factors was observed between studies. Although there were substantial inconsistencies regarding which patient characteristics were predictive of HF-related adverse outcomes, brain natriuretic peptide, New York Heart Association class and CHD lesion characteristics were shown to be important predictors. To date, evidence in the published literature is insufficient to accurately profile patients with ACHD. High-quality studies are required to develop a unique ACHD-HF prediction model and confirm the predictive roles of potential risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional decision rules have limitations when a new technology is less effective and less costly than a comparator. We propose a new probabilistic decision framework to examine non-inferiority in effectiveness and net monetary benefit (NMB) simultaneously. We illustrate this framework using the example of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression.
METHODS: We modeled the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the new intervention (rTMS), an active control (ECT), and a placebo control, and we estimated the fraction of effectiveness preserved by the new intervention through probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). We then assessed the probability of cost-effectiveness using a traditional cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) and our new decision-making framework. In our new framework, we considered the new intervention cost-effective in each simulation of the PSA if it preserved at least 75 percent of the effectiveness of the active control (thus demonstrating non-inferiority) and had a positive NMB at a given willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP).
RESULTS: rTMS was less effective (i.e., associated with fewer QALYs) and less costly than ECT. The traditional CEAC approach showed that the probabilities of rTMS being cost-effective were 100 percent, 39 percent, and 14 percent at WTPs of \$0, \$50,000, and \$100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. In the new decision framework, the probabilities of rTMS being cost-effective were reduced to 23 percent, 21 percent, and 13 percent at WTPs of \$0, \$50,000, and \$100,000 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This new framework provides a different perspective for decision making with considerations of both non-inferiority and WTP thresholds.},

Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study within a provincial linked database of 5718 cardiac patients with thorax and head or neck cancer having undergone radiotherapy between 2000 and 2011. One thousand five hundred fifty-two patients were identified as nonstatin users and 4166 as statin users. The primary outcome of interest was the composite of cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) or cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction). Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed. The crude event rate was 10.31\% for nonusers and 9.03\% for statin users (hazard ratio of 0.92 [95\% CI 0.76-1.10, P=0.3451]), over a mean time to event/censoring of 534±687 days for nonusers and 594±706 days for the statin users. After adjusting for age, sex, prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and hypertension, statin use postradiotherapy was associated with a nonsignificant 15\% relative risk reduction, but a strong trend toward reducing the primary outcome (hazard ratio=0.85 95\% CI 0.69-1.04, P=0.0811). The use of statins was associated with a significant reduction of 32\% for the outcome of stroke alone (hazard ratio=0.68, 95\% CI 0.48-0.98, P=0.0368). Conclusions Statin use post radiation therapy was associated with a significant reduction in stroke, with a trend toward significantly reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Very few practical frameworks exist to guide the formulation of recommendations at hospital-based health technology assessment (HTA) units. The objectives of our study were: (i) to identify decision criteria specific to the context of hospital-based health technologies and interventions, (ii) to estimate the extent to which the expert community agrees on the importance of the identified criteria, (iii) to incorporate the identified criteria into a decision-aid tool, and (iv) to illustrate the application of a prototype decision-aid tool.
METHODS: Relevant decision criteria were identified using existing frameworks for HTA recommendations, our past experience, a literature search, and feedback from a survey of diverse stakeholders.
RESULTS: Based on the survey results, twenty-three decision criteria were incorporated into the final framework. We defined an approach that eschewed a scoring system, but instead relied on a visual means for arriving at a final recommendation, by juxtaposing the importance rating for each criterion against the results of the health technology assessment. For a technology to be approved, a majority of criteria considered important should also have received favorable findings.
CONCLUSIONS: We created a simple and practical decision-aid tool that incorporates all decision criteria relevant to a hospital-based HTA unit. With its ease of use and accessibility, our tool renders the subjective decision-making process more structured and transparent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 is a recognized risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its effect on disease progression and subsequent events is unclear, raising questions about its value for stratification of residual risk.
METHODS: A variant at chromosome 9p21 (rs1333049) was tested for association with subsequent events during follow-up in 103 357 Europeans with established CHD at baseline from the GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) Consortium (73.1\% male, mean age 62.9 years). The primary outcome, subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction (CHD death/myocardial infarction), occurred in 13 040 of the 93 115 participants with available outcome data. Effect estimates were compared with case/control risk obtained from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) including 47 222 CHD cases and 122 264 controls free of CHD.
RESULTS: Meta-analyses revealed no significant association between chromosome 9p21 and the primary outcome of CHD death/myocardial infarction among those with established CHD at baseline (GENIUS-CHD odds ratio, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.05). This contrasted with a strong association in CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D odds ratio 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.22; P for interaction {\textless}0.001 compared with the GENIUS-CHD estimate. Similarly, no clear associations were identified for additional subsequent outcomes, including all-cause death, although we found a modest positive association between chromosome 9p21 and subsequent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.09).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to studies comparing individuals with CHD to disease-free controls, we found no clear association between genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 and risk of subsequent acute CHD events when all individuals had CHD at baseline. However, the association with subsequent revascularization may support the postulated mechanism of chromosome 9p21 for promoting atheroma development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease (GENIUS-CHD) consortium was established to facilitate discovery and validation of genetic variants and biomarkers for risk of subsequent CHD events, in individuals with established CHD.
METHODS: The consortium currently includes 57 studies from 18 countries, recruiting 185 614 participants with either acute coronary syndrome, stable CHD, or a mixture of both at baseline. All studies collected biological samples and followed-up study participants prospectively for subsequent events.
RESULTS: Enrollment into the individual studies took place between 1985 to present day with a duration of follow-up ranging from 9 months to 15 years. Within each study, participants with CHD are predominantly of self-reported European descent (38\%-100\%), mostly male (44\%-91\%) with mean ages at recruitment ranging from 40 to 75 years. Initial feasibility analyses, using a federated analysis approach, yielded expected associations between age (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.16) per 5-year increase, male sex (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.21) and smoking (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.35-1.51) with risk of subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction and differing associations with other individual and composite cardiovascular endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: GENIUS-CHD is a global collaboration seeking to elucidate genetic and nongenetic determinants of subsequent event risk in individuals with established CHD, to improve residual risk prediction and identify novel drug targets for secondary prevention. Initial analyses demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a federated analysis approach. The consortium now plans to initiate and test novel hypotheses as well as supporting replication and validation analyses for other investigators.},
