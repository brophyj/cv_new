summary: Presentation CORE Seminar Series - Biostatistical Principles and Practices 
abstract: "The three objectives of this talk were to \n
1) Understand the basics to operationalize Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) \n
2) Appreciate the insights into confounding and selection bias provided by DAGs  \n
3) Examine examples to appreciate the importance of DAGs (and their encoded substantive knowledge) on the road to causal inference   \n

My take home messages from this presentation were;     \n   
1) Causal interpretations are not possible by uniquely examing statistical associations   \n 
2) Causal interpretations can only be made by the sensible inclusion of external judgement or evidence  \n
3) DAGs help avoid common biases including confounding and selection bias  \n
4) DAGs help identify causal effects by deriving testable implications of a causal model"
